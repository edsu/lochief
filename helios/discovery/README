Copy or link the files in solr/conf/ to the solr/conf directory of your
running Solr instance.  Do the same for the files in solr/lib (you may need to
create the lib directory) -- the schema.xml in solr/conf depends on them.

MARC indexing depends on the pymarc python library.  See
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymarc

MARC records are expected to be in UTF8.  Try the yaz-marcdump tool, part of
YAZ (http://www.indexdata.com/yaz/), for converting from MARC8 if necessary.
